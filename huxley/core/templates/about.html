    <h2> DAIS </h2>
    <p> Hi there! We're glad you're interested in learning more about DAIS, NUMUN's Conference Management system.</p>

    <h3>What is DAIS?</h3>
    <p>DAIS stands for Delegate and Adviser Information System, but it is used by everyone at NUMUN. Advisers use DAIS to register for the conference. Chairs and their dais staff use DAIS to take attendance. Secretariat uses DAIS to monitor the entire conference from wherever they happen to be. Delegates generally aren't familiar with DAIS, but it knows a lot about them.</p>
    <h3>DAIS is Based on Huxley</h3>
    <p>DAIS is the result of hours of our own work, but it wouldn't be possible without a lot of help from California. The underlying system behind DAIS is called "Huxley" and it was created by and for Berkeley Model UN. But the creators didn't stop there. They released Huxley to the public and opened the code to public contributions on Github, a website that allows developers from around to collaborate on projects.</p>
    <p>Michael McCarthy, who currently serves as Tech Director, modified Huxley to fit NUMUN's needs and redesigned the visual experience of the application. We would like to thank him for his endless efforts to make NUMUN better through technology.</p>
    <p>In spirit with our friends at Berkeley, we will publicly release the code for DAIS and work to integrate some of our changes back into the original Huxley project.</p>
    <p>If you host a Model UN conference and you'd like to use Huxley, check out the <a href="https://github.com/bmun/huxley">project</a> on Github.
    <h3> About the Huxley Creators </h3>
        <p>Huxley was created by Kunal Mehta and William Chieng, two 3rd-year Cal Computer Science undergraduates. Their hobbies including writing code and kicking ass.</p>
    <h3> Our Tools </h3>
        <p> We used a lot of great tools to put this app together. Check them out below:</p>
